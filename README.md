##  Implementation

I made this little game for the JS basic project for the online academy of start2impact. The project request was to create a working  counter app wich allows the users to increase/decrease/reset the display value by pressing the related buttons.




## Technical requirements

The application must be developed with JavaScript. The use of jQuery is not allowed, and neither is the use of any frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, or others). The use of external JavaScript libraries is allowed if necessary. The +/- buttons and the display of the counter value must be built using DOM manipulation with JavaScript. Once the elements are built with JavaScript, the function to increase and decrease the counter value must be implemented. All additional functionalities deemed necessary are allowed.
